# BachNet

The project involved training a model that is capable of generating harmonies given amelody. The final model employed a sequence-to-sequence structure where eachharmony gets generated by separate GRU encoders and decoders before beingcombined with a fully connected output layer. This model managed to generateharmonies that closely resemble human-created arrangements regardless of thekey in which the melody is played, largely due to the employed data augmentationstrategy.  However, even though Bach’s chorales were used as training data, thegenerated compositions do not, necessarily, sound reminiscent of the composer’swork as they employ more modern syncopated rhythms. This is due to the one-hotencoding that was used, showing that special care should be taken when designingthe numerical representation of music.

# How to run

- Download the data from `www.github.com/czhuang/JSB-Chorales-dataset` and place the file `Jsb16thSeparated.npz` inside `trainer/data`.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- To train, run `task.py`: `python3 task.py`. 
- To generate melodies run: `python3 performer.py`. Inside the main function within the file, there is the option to change the melody to generate harmonies for.
