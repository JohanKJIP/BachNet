# BachNet

Our project will aim to generate musical choral harmonies in the style of Bach given a melody. Essentially, we wish to create a network that performs similarly to the Bach harmonization Google Doodle, which used a convolutional network called CocoNet. The proposed approach is to use a LSTM-based network, as they are well suited to temporally connected data. Another useful reference will be folk-RNN which generates melodies using LSTMs.
